    "To build our model we will use a two-layered bidirectional RNN with LSTMs on the input data and two layers, each with an LSTM using bahdanau attention on the target data. [Jaemin Cho's tutorial](https://github.com/j-min/tf_tutorial_plus/tree/master/RNN_seq2seq/contrib_seq2seq) for seq2seq was really helpful to get the code in working order because this is my first project with TensorFlow 1.1; some of the functions are very different from 1.0. The architecture for this model is similar to Xin Pan's and Peter Liu's, here's their [GitHub page.](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/textsum)\n",

For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said.
